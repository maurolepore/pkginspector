## Example

library(dplyr)
```

Review dependency usage: Count used functions from external packages.

```{r}
# Usnig default path to review dependency usage of pkgreviewr
n_deps <- rev_dependency_usage()

# You may want to remove dependency on packages from which you use few functions
# As tibble truncates `functions` so they use no more than a single line
as_tibble(arrange(n_deps, n))
```

```{r}
# `kable()` lets you see al functions even if they don't fit in a single line.
knitr::kable(n_deps)
```
